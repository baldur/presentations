        <!--
          Concepts like Devops and fullstack have really influenced
          our thinking on solving these types of problems

          I think it's really important though to emphasize what those
          things are not

          Devops is not a job title
          Full stack is not a job title

          These are cultural values ...
          Lets face it there should only be one title
          Problem solvers (I,II,III)

          I know .. what you're thinking
          scandinavian name ... he's such a socialist ... right?

          We build things, make it better, we deploy it we watch it grow.
          We do so many things and the only thing that is a constant
          is scratching your head while staring at the computer
          trying to debug a really heavy problem
          only to realize you left of a comma or didn't camelcase
          something preoperly

          By the way to those who are new to this profession
          THAT NEVER GOES AWAY ... THAT PAIN/JOY IS A CONSTANT

          This book is about an employee that all of a sudden gets
          promoted into a big role
          where he's now in charge of a rollout of a new technology call the
          phoenix project that is falling behind and it sort of a disaster

          His approach is basically getting everyone in the same room and log
          problems and correctly identify the source of the problem and then
          working as a team to solve them ... by bridging the gap between
          engineers, opererations and database administrators as well as business

          Deployments become less risky because they are more frequent and
          thus smaller chunks going out etc

          If you can work like this where day is just a day where your solving
          bugs, building features, deploying them without looking back ... do it

          If you work in a regularytory environment try to make sure you automate
          all the testing and do all the required insturmentation so that you can do it too.

          Think about this
          -> know the problem, never guess
          -> instrument for information you don't have
          -> be alerted when things go wrong, so you know before your customer
          -> TEST tesT test auotmate test

          These are all things that are vital to your business ... which is
          a corner stone in the devops movement

          not "cool new technologies you'd like to get your hands on"

          How did I make my business better today ...
            -> is it cheaper?
               server bill lower
            -> is it better?
               faster ... more stable ... can you messure it
            -> both

          Which was a bell labs innovation stratedgy

          When large enterprices realize this
          it can be translated directly into dollars and cents.
          Any inefficencies are costly.

          This makes sense where you have
          a large team with different groups within ... mobile, backend, database administrators,
          linux administrators, integrators, security engineers etc.

          It's different when you have 5-10 engineers and you're moving
          at lighting speed trying to prove out your business

          But remember to move fast you can't think about next, hour, next, day
          or next week only.
          You should develop a culture of doing the right thing fast
          every day.

          And persist your velocity for days, weeks, months, years
          you have to bridge the gap between development and production

          Do this well and you can stay small and nimble for longer ...
          extend your runway and a better chance to prove out your
          business

          For developers this also is important because the better you know
          and understand the environment your code runs on
          the better you are at discovering problems and take advantage
          of systems characteristics

          This means you can now stack them and run 100s on your laptop

          Before I go any further I'd like to address the elephant in the room
          PaaS services. Platform as a service.
          Things like
          Heroku and AWS lambda

          These technologies are great and to certain extend the future and
          they can work if you are ok with living with in those limitations and cost

          I'd argue it doesn't close the gap it more hides it
          or obfuscates it, which might be right for you or your business
          just research if any of the limitations affects your business

          kinda just pretends there isn't a gap

          I'd encourage you to use it if you can but still try to this other
          stuff to bet better at your craft

          Also I'll admit I should learn Heroku better ... I know they
          have some amazing feature set. And as a sidenote
          there is open source software that allows you to run
          things in heroku style but on your cluster ... if you're into that
          stort of stuff

          build your own platform service

          Also I don't think Heroku does a great job solving the local workflow
          and versions you have on your computer.

        <!--
          Is the tool where I think developers and ops can really collaborate
        -->

        <!--
          Understand how your code gets to produciton responsibly ... what's the best way to deploy to servers
          provision your servers. Go a little deeper than just the surface and name drop technologies.
          I've been trying to get the sense of this world for my entire carrer and I still feel like I am only
          scratching the surface ... and barely able to talk to operations professionals. But getting your
          organization into the mindset of understanding and doing the right thing is always valuable

          Keep things simple ... complexity is the enemy ... infact you're paid to make complex things simple
